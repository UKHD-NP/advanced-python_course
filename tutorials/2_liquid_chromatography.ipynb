    "Liquid chromatography (LC) separates peptides in time before they enter the mass spectrometer. By separating them first by LC, the mass spectrometer only needs to co-analyze smaller groups of peptides, increasing the overall accuracy and reliability of the results. In bottom-up proteomics we typically use **reverse-phase LC**, where the stationary phase is hydrophobic and the mobile phase gets gradually more organic. Hydrophobic peptides stick longer and elute later, while hydrophilic peptides elute early."
